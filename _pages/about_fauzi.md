I'm a software engineer and writer who loves working with developers to create cool apps. I use the latest technology, especially AI4SE, to make apps that solve real problems and make life better. To keep growing and trying new things to make a meaningful contribution with my work and writing, I share my works on github, medium, and here blog. It's all about getting better and making an impact!
