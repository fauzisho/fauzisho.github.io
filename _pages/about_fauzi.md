As a mobile application developer at Red Circle AI, I applied my mobile engineering skills and knowledge to create innovative and user-friendly apps for various domains and platforms. I worked with a diverse and collaborative team of engineers, designers, and product managers to deliver high-quality and scalable solutions that met the client's needs and expectations.

I have a Master of Philosophy in Computer Science from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, where I conducted research on mobile development and software quality. I have multiple certifications in cloud computing, data engineering, and machine learning from Qwiklabs and Stanford University, and a Google Play Academy certificate for store listing optimization.

My passion is to use AI and mobile technologies to create impactful and meaningful solutions that can improve people's lives and solve real-world problems. I am always eager to learn new skills and tools, and to share my knowledge and experience with others through my GitHub, Medium, and ResearchGate profiles. I am looking for new opportunities and challenges that can help me grow as a professional and as a person.
